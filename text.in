Golden Smog's lineup was chiefly made up of Kraig Johnson (Run Westy Run), Dan Murphy (Soul Asylum) Jeff Tweedy (Wilco) and 
Gary Louris and bassist Marc Perlman (both of The Jayhawks). It had been 
8 years since 1998's Weird Tales release by the group. In the meantime, 
the Jayhawks broke up and Soul Asylum went on hiatus. Tweedy's band 
Wilco had achieved success with albums such as Yankee Hotel Foxtrot 
and A Ghost Is Born.

Another Fine Day features vocals by Tweedy, Murphy and Louris.
 It included a cover version of The Kinks' 1970 song "Strangers".
