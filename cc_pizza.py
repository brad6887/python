"""One summer evening, while curled up with her beloved Cheese-kun plushie, C.C. begins craving pizza. 
Although she would really like a large, extra-cheesy pizza, her stomach is willing to settle for anything. 
Without hesitation, she snatches up Lelouch's credit card and makes a very important phone callâ€¦

C.C. will be absolutely satisfied if the pizza she gets has a width of 3 units and an extra-cheesiness of at least 95%.
C.C. will be fairly satisfied if the pizza she gets has a width of 1 unit and an extra-cheesiness of at most 50% .
C.C. will be very satisfied with any other pizza she receives."""
